Hi, this is your installation guide.

Just execute "Start This.bat" which executes "python converter.py" -> starts the Converter

IMPORTANT:
The file to convert has to be in the same Directory like the Converter itself.
Then you enter your output File name [format .ico already given].

requirements:
- pip install pillow 
- tkinter

Enjoy,
