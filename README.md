Hi, this is your installation guide.
After having installed this package you have to run pngtoico.exe and then enter your file name.
IMPORTANT:
The File to export to .ico has to be in the same directory as the pngtoico.exe file and all the others.

Then you enter your output File name [format .ico already given].

Enjoy,
